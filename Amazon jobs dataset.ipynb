      "You are an experienced hands-on manager with a background in developing and delivering software that simplifies solutions for a broad set of related problems. You have a strong technical ability, great communication skills, and know how to inspire your team to achieve outstanding results in a fast paced environment. You have a track record of building and leading strong teams of talented engineers and you enjoy working with smart people. In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.AWS Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any AWS service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing AWS business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine \"declarative\". We want to make it super easy for sellers of cloud services to create complex pricing plans with minimal or no code changes whatsoever.Key Responsibilities:Â· Adopt overall AWS plans for AWS Commerce Platform and define your own team's future direction.Â· Â· Manage projects that deliver on commitments to our customers.Â· Â· Manage day-to-day activities of engineering team using Agile/Scrum methodology.Â· Â· Manage team's resources: hire, mentor, and grow the engineering team.Â· Â· Work closely with engineers to architect and develop the best technical solutions.

      "The mission of the Systems Intelligence team is to provide situational awareness to Amazonâs leaders enabling them to make decisions that will directly impact the culture of software development. An SDE is critical to the success of this team to build the data lake that enable our leaders to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazonâs internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement.In 2018, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.You will lead all phases of software development to build services to support our goal. Your systems will drive service and product efficiency opportunities, from idea generation to scoping, to strategy building and ultimately automation for self- monitoring, self-diagnosing and self-healing solutions.

We serve and respond to hundreds of billions of requests annually, and have ambitions to grow that number several orders of magnitude, while maintaining response latencies in the milliseconds and meeting strict SLA requirements. We delight in data, and are constantly trying to enrich our models and make more informed decisions using every bit and byte we have. Our current systems serve our current needs, but we are growing a new business within Amazon.com, and are looking for the sort of hands on leaders and developers who can design and build the systems that will take us into the future.About you:You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space. You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given an opportunity to own and drive initiatives through the entire software stack -- from customer facing features, to algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.About us together:We're going to change the way that the advertising world measures, plans, and buys. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.The ideal developer for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.Some problem spaces we'll be working on:AD PLATFORM - accessing this data and making decisions across large numbers of potential responses in a matter of milliseconds is a tough problem, and requires complex high scale engineering both online and offline. You may specialize in one area or another, but will need to consider the problem holistically. Today, we are a global operation with infrastructure in North America, Europe and Asia and we are looking to enter India and Brazil. Our platform is hosted in AWS and we serve ads for Mobile (mobile web, Amazon mobile APPs and 3rd Party Mobile Apps) and Desktop Web (both on Amazon owned and operated properties as well as third party sites via Ad Exchanges and Direct relationships). we are looking to continue to rearchitect the platform this year to better enable us to handle the demands of scaling the business enabling both enterprise managed- and self-service growth in addition to small business self-service growth.OPTIMIZATION - we have a wealth of data already about the customers we interact with; what they've been shopping for, what they've recently purchased, etc. Couple that with an almost overwhelming amount of real-time data and the need to build the best models to predict which signals are likely to have an impact and which aren't. We're building platforms to automate the generation, validation, and publishing of models that incorporate all available data to predict performance against our customers' goals. Youâll need to be both an engineer and scientist â youâll build the platforms to test and measure your hypotheses, iterate on your designs, and find innovative signals and solutions that fundamentally shift the effectiveness of our systems.EXPERIMENTATION - advertisers spend a lot of money to develop their ads, and we want to ensure that those ads will drive the best performance possible. To do so, we need to develop the data, analysis and technical frameworks to enable incredibly precise, highly impactful decisions that directly impact the ad performance. Furthermore, the experimentation framework needs to provide the ability for our internal partners to configure and execute experiments on our algorithms and infrastructure with sufficiently low friction to encourage further experimentation.Questions?:You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.\n",

      "Amazon.com's long-term vision is to enable a seamless experience for all Amazon customers worldwide on any Amazon website and device, in any language and for any culture. This extends the personalization of the shopping experience by allowing our customers to define their preferred language and currency and ensure that we provide an equivalent experience for our customers in their language of preference as we do customers in the default marketplace language.Our team started in early 2014 and, as of February 2018, we have launched multiple languages in 4 different marketplaces (US, Canada, Japan and Germany). Our goal is to provide a framework allowing us to define and measure the quality of these experiences and accelerate language adoption across marketplaces. We believe that, by establishing a platform team and providing tools and mechanisms to drive the adoption of this platform, we can broadly influence change across Amazon's Consumer Website while and auditing the quality of our customer experiences.About you:You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically, and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap, and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Amazon Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.About us together:We're going to change the way that Amazon thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.The ideal manager for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment and passion for building a great customer experience, be inventive, and have a strong track record of delivery. You also have a pragmatic approach and iterative approach to building software: you have an ability to simplify and get things done with a demonstrated track record of building and delivering software and working effectively with external and internal teams.Some problem spaces we'll be working on:LANGUAGE AND CURRENCY API ADOPTION - we need to develop a toolset that allows us to identify the set of teams across the Consumer org that should use our International preferences APIs and manage the program that will cause them to adopt these APIs. Given the scale of the problem, self-service tools are a necessity as automation is the path for success. We will be instrumental in defining the standards and approaches used broadly across Amazon as well as developing mechanisms that will audit our customer experience ensuring that we can identify and address any measurable deviation.LARGE MIGRATIONS - we have already identified several areas of increased risk, where adoption of the preferences APIs will be impactful to the owning teams' roadmaps. In these cases, we must influence the teams to develop a suitable design that meets the needs of the International consumer, driving thought leadership from a International perspective. Problems such as how we think about customer reviews in multiple languages and determining the customer satisfaction with the product fall under the remit of this space.END-TO-END TESTING - once we have addressed all of these issues, we must develop end-to-end test scenarios that will allow us to validate our work throughout the complexity of Amazon's Consumer stack.Questions?:As you can see, this provides an opportunity to be exposed to Amazon's entire consumer stack. You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.\n",

Amazonâs Prime Video service launched in 2014 and has quickly become a strategic priority for the organization, reflected in the serviceâs recent expansion into over 200 countries and territories around the world. Amazon invests on acquiring, producing and programming TV shows & movies â from brand new, including must-see exclusive series like The Grand Tour, Neil Gaimanâs American Gods, to The Man in the High Castle, Transparent, Mr Robot and more.Prime Video is known for its ground-breaking impact, and in case you think there is nothing more to do, then think again. We are building a new global innovation platform designed to transform how we develop, test, verify and automate against physical devices. With hundreds of devices currently supported, and many more being certified in the future, we are changing how we work with devices to ensure that even at this scale we can assure the exceptional customer experience at all times.Prime Video product teams are continually striving to deliver more features, and platform improvements, faster through CI/CD delivery platforms. With platform complexity increasing, and aggressive increases in the number of customer device types, our ability to test on customer devices has understandably struggled to keep up.Join us on a mission to change that!We are designing the next generation cloud platform for both physical and virtual devices.As we work from the physical tiers, onto micro-processors and right through to rack capacity we will be building custom solutions from the hardware systems to the contention management software. We aim to take away the complexity of device management, so that it can become a plug-and-play global network of self-managing, and self-healing, capacity.We work from the AWS cloud down, so we will be wrapping this all up securely using the latest AWS frameworks and tools into consumable RESTful APIs. Clients will be delivered as well as SDKs to enable customers to integrate and extend the capabilities.We are looking for builders, inventors and generally awesome engineers.

Then please apply, join us, and make historyâ¦Working with devices is a hard engineering problem, due to the fact that they typically share no standard operating system, I/O, installation or debugging tooling. We have to support all of them from the latest Android right through to Smart TVs.Our mission is to solve this problem. We plan to make working with devices easy to the point that it becomes a transparent platform with homogeneous APIs no matter how complex the device itself might be.We are looking for outstanding inventors who can design, build and own both low level hardware systems and integration with networks and networked capabilities such as power over IP racks, VPN systems, and SMART TVs and games consoles.You will be working to create software driven capabilities to control devices using micro-processors, or flashing firmware using APIs, as well as working out how to rack mount and control TVs and boards in racks globally. Operational excellence is also your concern, and so you will be expected to define and implement metrics, and operational systems to monitor them, to ensure a reliable, performant, secure and frugal platform is provided to consumers.Ideally you will be a polyglot who cares about using the right language and tool for the job, as opposed to thinking only within the limits of your own experience. If you want to stretch yourself, as well as the boundaries of what is possible in modern tech then look no further.This really is an opportunity to make history and own your future. You do not need to know everything, you just need to want to, and bring along a bag of enthusiasm and positivity for the journey. Sign up. Make the impact you always wanted to.You will be an inventor working with a talented team of like-minded inventors.

      "Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) powers the physical engine at the heart of Amazon. AFT builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Flow management is aimed at balancing the input and output of physical processes while minimizing the buffers between them. Balanced flow is achieved when the input from an upstream process is equal to the output of its downstream process. In the context of our fulfillment centers (FCs), everything that is picked has to be packed and everything that is received has to be stowed. When the rate at which the FC is picking is equal to the rate at which the FC is packing (or conversely receiving/stowing) we achieve balanced flow. Outbound Flow is a flow management solution that automates human decision points for our fulfillment center leads. It removes the need for these individuals to manage software controls and allows them to focus on managing people. All the sophistication and technical complexity is moved to software systems. Outbound Flow automates intra-day shift planning and labor allocation. The system uses capacity and charge (incoming customer orders) forecast information to determine the right allocation of labor across processes at the start of the shift. It also monitors buffers throughout the day and uses a cost-based system using mathematical models to decide if and when to move labor.The vision for Outbound Flow is that when associates clock-in at the start of shift, they are presented with a message that tells them which process area to report to. This is based on the optimal start of shift labor allocation computed by the system and accounts for their training. Over the course of the day, when the system detects a need to move labor, the corresponding associates are presented with a message on their scanner to move to the new process area. Similarly, when operations and area managers start their shifts, they are presented with the system-generated shift plan for the day and are able to monitor the production rates for their area. They are notified when there is a deviation from the plan that requires their intervention (e.g. insufficient labor/capacity, missed rate targets, etc.). The Outbound Flow system automatically manages software controls, performs load balancing across process paths, and moves labor when appropriate. We work backwards from the customer and eliminate all fulfillment related misses.As a member of a small team, you will get the opportunity to work on highly visible, innovative projects that directly impact the customer experience. You will be involved in all the aspects of the software development cycle including scoping, design, implementation, testing & delivery of your product. Our engineers are top-notch software developers who love listening to the customers, working as a team, and proactively taking the lead whenever necessary.â\n",

      "We are seeking a Senior Software Development Engineer to lead the team that will help develop Alexa as the most personal, all-knowing shopping assistant in the world.Personalization is a key component of the voice shopping flywheel, and a critical experience to nail for our customers. In this capacity, you will work closely with Alexa teams to build delightful experiences and with Amazon Retail teams to harmonize the how we personalize across both shopping mediums. In this role, you will have the freedom (and encouragement) to experiment, improve, invent, and innovate on behalf of our customers. You will have the satisfaction of being able to look back and say you were a key contributor to something special from its earliest stages. You will lead a team of talented and experienced engineers to define and deliver the natural language shopping experiences for Echo, Fire TV and other Amazon products.Strategy:Our vision is to make Alexa the most personal voice shopping assistant ever by delighting customers with unique âAlexa gets meâ shopping experiences. We will achieve this by building and constantly updating rich customer profile based on Amazon wide customer signals. This customer profile will help in modeling their explicit and implicit preferences which can then be used to serve up personalized offers at various steps of their engagement with Alexa like when they are looking to discover deals, searching for specific products for themselves or gifts for others or building their shopping carts across different Amazon programs. Initially, we will start by offering personalized recommendations when customers explicitly engage with Alexa. Over time, as customers build trust with us, we will proactively reach out to them with unique, personalized shopping offers based on what we know about their needs and preferences.Alexa must understand the customer and their preferences comprehensively. When asked, âWhat are my deals?â Alexa will sort through an expanded selection â thousands of deals available on Amazon.com daily â to offer personalized deal recommendations based on that customerâs behaviors: what they have been searching for, what they have added to their shopping list, or items previously purchased with a high propensity for reorder. Beyond deals, personalization will improve general shopping queries as well. Does the customer often add âorganicâ to their Amazon.com searches? Alexa will prioritize organic offers in response to requests for groceries. When a customer asks for diapers, the right recommender can identify diaper size based on prior buying patterns and projected age of the child. A recommender for minimum order value will suggest a complement to a past purchase (e.g., the right battery, the right refill). To achieve this, we will integrate with all available .com sources of profile and preference, investing in a customer profile ingestion for voice we can join in order to continuously learn customer patterns across Amazon data stores. We will ingest signals such as past purchases, navigational refinements, web, and voice queries to create a rich model of customer preferences. Reusing technology wherever possible, we will enable a Personal Ranking Engine that flows aggregate customer profile data into a set of recommender strategies, leveraging MAB for continuous improvement.If this sounds intriguing, then weâd like to talk to you about this role.\n",

But the way businesses shop has not seen the kind of innovation and friction shopping experience that Amazon has provided to consumers. With Amazon Business (AB) we intend to change this status-quo. It is Day 1 for us at Amazon Business and our mission is to bring the same innovation and customer obsession expected of Amazon as we build a new shopping experience for our business customers. Amazon Business has now crossed $2B in GMS within 2 years of its inception and is targeting a large addressable B2B market.Amazon Business is a new team tasked with a singular goal to create a world class and differentiated shopping experience for business customers. And now we are expanding to Hyderabad, India. The Hyderabad Amazon Business team has been tasked with the charter to transform the current \"Search, Browse and Shop\" experience to build a consumer equivalent simpler shopping experience for Businesses.It is a great chance to get in early on building new platforms and features tailored for business customers. This includes deep technical problems such as search and personalization based on the industry the business is in and the job function of the person shopping at Amazon. Many of these features do not exist for Amazon customers now and this is a chance to architect and build systems from ground up with little or no operational issues.Our customer base ranges from mom-and-pop shops to mid-sized companies and enterprise customers. Our customers are employees of these businesses and buy specific products based on their job roles and they buy these products repeatedly. Additionally enterprise customers may want to restrict the products that their employees can buy on Amazon.com and may even have custom prices negotiated with suppliers. There are other elements associated with selling to businesses including the need to support purchase groups, invoices and integration with customer's purchasing systems.We will innovate by building new experiences where there exists none today, by building features focused on business shoppers (e.g. repeat purchase, search and personalization for business) or extend the current experience to include business requirements (e.g. analytics to provide data for businesses to help switch from their existing procurement pipelines to AB). We need to revamp detail pages for products incorporating business user requirements while maintaining tight latency requirements. But it is still Day 1 for us as we explore the various facets of purchasing behavior of businesses.We are a fun loving team that works hard on producing customer and business value with very low operational load. It is a chance to get in on the ground floor of a large and critical initiative for Amazon. We are betting big and we would love to have you join us in this journey.\n",

      "Are you a hands-on leader that can make a huge impact on a dynamic, fast moving business? Are you equally comfortable digging in to business requirements as drilling into architecture and design with development teams? Amazon fulfillment Technology organization is looking for a Sr. Manager to lead multiple software development teams in the Pick Planning space.Amazon Fulfillment Technologies (AFT) builds and operates software, hardware, and processes that run the global network of fulfillment centers(FCs) that move many millions of units of inventory, employ tens of thousands of people, and ensure that customers get what they want when we promised we would get it to them. We do this by building automated solutions to handle things that technology does well, while relying on people to handle things that humans do well.Picking is the process that starts the fulfillment of an order in the FC. In manual FCs, it involves sending people to pick stuff that has been stowed in seemingly arbitrary shelves/bins, and then use a combination of software, hardware & processes to sort, pack and ship the item out to the customer. In FCs that deploy Amazon Robotics, this involves directing a Kiva robot to bring the item to an individual in the most optimal way possible. Picking is critical to shipping any order to our customer. At the same time, itâs a space that involves huge optimization problems, and possibility for a lot of automation using robotics solutions.While Amazon is expanding the number of fulfillment centers, small & big, the team needs to model the variations in the different types of fulfillment centers in its software, and minimize the cost of fulfilling an order, while meeting the promise we made to the customer.This space is challenging both architecturally and algorithmically. 100s of millions of customers place thousands of orders on Amazon every year, and a large percentage of orders have more than one item on it. These billions of transactions are processed via our systems, spending 100s of millions of dollars on labor. There is huge potential for optimizing how we group orders, how we model downstream capacity and constraints and maximize their utilization.As Amazon introduces different kinds of automation in the fulfillment processes, the platform needs to be flexible to offer a plug & Play architecture allowing optimal use of the automation equipment.Responsibilities:Â· Manage multiple high performing teams, possibly even a remote team.Â· Manage overall software development life-cycle via your leadersÂ· Create, prioritize, communicate, manage, and execute roadmaps, project plans, and commitmentsÂ· Report on status of development, quality, operations, and system performance to managementÂ· Work closely with Sr. engineers and Team Leaders to architect and develop the best technical design and approachÂ· Foster culture of continuous engineering improvement through mentoring, feedback, and metricsÂ· Hire, coach, and mentor individuals; build a strong cross-functional organizationÂ· Interface with a diverse customer base to understand requirements, priorities, and processesÂ· Propose and implement new projects or recommend system improvements.Â· Own all operational metrics and supportÂ· Have the obsession to drive a better customer experience through everything that we do here at AmazonÂ· Bring innovative ideas to the table every day, in order to find better ways of accomplishing our customer objectivesÂ· Set clear, measurable quality goals for an organization in a data-driven wayPersonal traits not unique to this position, but necessary for Amazon leaders:Â· Exhibits excellent judgment, are right a lotÂ· Hire and develop the best peopleÂ· Able to dive deep and never out of touch with the details of the businessÂ· Strong results orientated approach.Â· Thinks big and have a bias for ActionÂ· Deal well with ambiguity\n",

You have a track record of building and leading strong teams of talented engineers and you enjoy working with smart people. In short - you are a skilled leader capable of getting great things done for your customers. If it sounds like you - then read on!As one of the largest companies in the cloud computing space across the world, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers dozens of services and processes billions of usage records. Over the past 10 years, Amazon has become known across the globe as the most trusted company on the internet.The systems we build interpret and process a very high volume stream of events; often bundled with low-latency/real-time analysis to enable security and fraud detection.AWS Bill Generation team manages the computation engine responsible for generating charges to the customers. Every time any AWS service meters a usage by a customer, a record makes its way to the our computation engine. At the simplest level, the bill computation engine generates bill line items corresponding to usage. Every day the bill computation engine processes hundreds of millions of records. The computation engine is architected to enable us to scale to this computational load and grow with the rapidly growing AWS business.There are numerous highly varied scenarios that the bill computation engine handles: the common most one is that of tiering, i.e. charging customers at different rates based on usage. These tiers may be computed across multiple dimensions: across geographical regions, across accounts, or across services. One of the key goals of the bill computation engine is to build a highly scalable, general purpose multi-dimensional counter mechanism that enables us to support a very flexible set of pricing models. Another key goal is to make the bill computation engine \"declarative\".
